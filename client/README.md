# WebApp with Next and React

We are using React and Next together to create a simple web application, an image bank using APIs to fetch data and images.  
Also we use tailwind css to style our pages.

## Prerequisites

This App requires to have installed Node.js

## Installing dependencies

Once the project is cloned or downloaded, you can run the following command to install all dependencies : 

```bash
npm install
```

## Testing

From the 'client' folder, you can launch the local version of the web application using the command :

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now access it through any search engine, parsing `http://localhost:3000/`
